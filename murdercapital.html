					<p> Murder Capital is a band alot more softer than they lead on with that name. Alot of there songs lead are post punk but lean towards remedeying in the saddnes
						of life. There first album "When I have Fears", I liked but was not an album I would revisit outside of a few songs. The album is drenched in self doupt
						and emotion with songs like, Don't Cling To Life and Twisted Grounds. Twisted Grounds is my favorite song on the album, while I like the album its too heavy handed
						with its themes and not explored enought that the elemets of sadness arnt really impactful.
					</p>
					<p>
						They have only released two albums and there second album, "Gigi's Recovery" is a much better and a much more consistant and
						well rounded LP. It still carries a saddness to it but its  interesting, catchier and 
						lyrically better than there previous project. My favorite songs from the album are: Gigi's Recovery, Return My Head, and We Had to Disappear.
