					<p> 
						Interpol is popular band from the early 2000's post punk revival, and to many have produced
										 one of the best post punk revival albums, "Turn On The Bright Lights". I have been of fan of theres since I was in late middle school and was introduced to
										them from the song "Evil". All there albums consist of post punk elemets and are coverd in a bleak gloom. They are still releasing albums with there
									newest one being from last year, titled The Other "Side of Make Believe".
					</p>
					<p>
					While  I don't like there newer material as much, there first three album: Turn On The Bright Lights, Antics, and Our Love To Admire, have
					had a large impact on the post punk revival and such phenomenal albums and I would rate them in that order. The Opener for "Our Love to Admire", is 
					one of the best openers to and album, which is "Pioneer to The Falls", the song being played.
