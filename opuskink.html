					<p> Opus kink is a band that I found going through random indie punk Spotify playlists and i'm glad I found them. They
						have such a hard hitting funky sound and great production. Suprisingly they are a very new band and have not even released a full leangth album.
						They have released on singles and an EP, but they have another EP coming out in a couple months.  
					</p>
					<p>
					Like alot the bands I have I just love when the saxaphone and jazz elements are used in punk. Like said before I heard about them throught a playlist
					and the first song I heard from them was Mostquito, which was somewhat nostalgic like I had heard it before. Something about is just so funky, and so well
					produced that I thought I had heard it in like a quentin tarantino movie or something. With the band having not released a full leangth LP yet, I really
					look forward to what they release.
